## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated magenta (#F037A5) for a bold and expressive feel, representing the dating context.
- Background color: Light pink (#FAE8EF), a desaturated version of magenta to ensure that the layout isn't overwhelmed with brightness, in accordance with a light color scheme.
- Accent color: Purple (#A63EC5), an analogous color to magenta, with less brightness and saturation.
- Font: 'Poppins', a geometric sans-serif, is suggested because its precise, contemporary, fashionable look suits headlines and short chunks of text. For longer text blocks, consider switching to a more readable font.
- Use modern, clean icons to represent various features and actions, ensuring they are easily recognizable and culturally relevant to the Indian audience.
- Design a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes and devices, ensuring a consistent user experience on both mobile and desktop.
- Incorporate subtle animations and transitions to enhance user engagement and provide visual feedback, such as smooth transitions between screens and interactive animations for profile interactions.
